      Hello! My name is Angelo Antimo, and I am a student at BYU studying Web
      Development. This is my homepage for WDD 130. I am currently 25 years
      old, and I love learning about new technologies and improving my skills.
      I recently got married to my beautiful wife, and we are excited to start
      this new chapter in our lives together. During my free time I enjoy
      playing basketball.
